## Introduction

In computing, unsigned integers are essential for various applications. The **Number Uint8 Base Mul** library focuses on multiplying two unsigned 8-bit integers. This means it can handle values from 0 to 255, ensuring you can work with small numbers efficiently.

## Features

- **Simple API**: Easy to use with minimal setup.
- **Performance**: Fast multiplication of unsigned integers.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Node.js and JavaScript environments.
- **Lightweight**: Small footprint, making it ideal for web applications.

## Installation

To install the **Number Uint8 Base Mul** library, you can use npm. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install number-uint8-base-mul
```

This command will add the library to your project, allowing you to use it right away.

## Usage

After installation, you can start using the library in your JavaScript or Node.js application. Hereâ€™s a quick guide on how to do that.

### Basic Usage

```javascript
const { multiply } = require('number-uint8-base-mul');

const result = multiply(12, 10);
console.log(result); // Output: 120
```

### Function Details

- **multiply(a, b)**: Takes two unsigned 8-bit integers and returns their product.

## Examples

Here are some examples to illustrate how to use the **Number Uint8 Base Mul** library effectively.

### Example 1: Basic Multiplication

```javascript
const { multiply } = require('number-uint8-base-mul');

const result = multiply(5, 5);
console.log(result); // Output: 25
```

### Example 2: Multiplying Larger Values

```javascript
const { multiply } = require('number-uint8-base-mul');

const result = multiply(200, 2);
console.log(result); // Output: 400
```

### Example 3: Handling Edge Cases

```javascript
const { multiply } = require('number-uint8-base-mul');

const result = multiply(255, 1);
console.log(result); // Output: 255
```
